👋 Hi, I’m Ragul Puhazhendi

Technical Product Manager | Agentic AI Builder | Robotics & CAD Strategy

I build real, demo-able AI products at the intersection of agentic systems, product strategy, and industrial software.
My work focuses on turning emerging AI capabilities into clear user value, measurable outcomes, and credible PM artifacts.

Currently:

Technical Product Manager Intern @ Amazon Robotics

Product Manager – Innovation Strategy (AI) @ Dassault Systèmes (SOLIDWORKS)

MBA (Management Science / Digital Tech), Boston University

🔭 What I’m Building
🤖 Agentic AI Products (0 → 1)

MunchMatch (FeastBid Engine)
Agent-driven reverse-auction marketplace for food ordering.
Multi-agent bidding, negotiation, and constraint optimization (budget, dietary, preference).

AI Product Council
Amazon-style AI decision system that generates PRFAQs, PRDs, ROI models, and trade-off logs using specialized agents (Finance, Eng, Ops, CX).

AI CAD Design Assistant
Multi-agent system that converts natural-language product specs into structured part definitions, BOMs, and CAD-ready outputs with evaluation guardrails.

🧠 What I Care About

Agentic system design (planning, memory, tools, evaluation)

PM-grade AI rigor (metrics, failure modes, economic feasibility)

Industrial & robotics AI (CAD, manufacturing, automation ROI)

I’m especially interested in where AI hype breaks — and how to design systems that still work in production.

📌 Featured Projects

🔹 MunchMatch – Agentic Reverse Auction App
Multi-agent bidding, negotiation chat, state machine, and demo flow
→ Shows how agents unlock new marketplace economics

🔹 AI Product Council
Decision ledger + PRFAQ + roadmap agents
→ Demonstrates AI-native product management

🔹 Agentic AI CAD Prototype
Spec → structure → validation pipeline
→ AI for engineers, not just prompts

📈 How I Think About AI Products

I design AI systems like products, not demos:

Clear user job

Explicit constraints

Measurable success criteria

Honest limitations

Viable economics

If it can’t survive a skeptical Principal PM review, it’s not done.
